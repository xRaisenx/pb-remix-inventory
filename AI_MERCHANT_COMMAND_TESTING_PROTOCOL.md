### **AI Interaction & Merchant Command Testing Protocol**

#### **1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Validation**  
- **Intent Recognition**  
  - Test ambiguous merchant queries (e.g., *"Show me best sellers but exclude clearance"*) → Verify correct filters applied.  
  - Mispronounced/wrongly spelled product names (e.g., *"Nike Air Maxx"*) → Check fuzzy matching.  
  - Multi-action commands (e.g., *"Add 5 red shirts to cart and apply discount"*) → Confirm sequential execution.  

- **Tone & Context**  
  - Test casual vs. formal language (e.g., *"Yo, what’s trending?"* vs. *"Display top-selling products"*) → Ensure consistent professionalism.  
  - Long conversational threads (e.g., *"Find blue shoes… No, under $100… Only size 10"*) → Validate context retention.  

#### **2. Query Execution & Data Accuracy**  
- **Read Operations**  
  - Complex filters (e.g., *"Show products with <5 stock, priced $20–50, tagged ‘Summer’"*) → Verify accurate query results.  
  - Cross-reference Shopify Reports → Ensure AI output matches Admin analytics.  

- **Write Operations**  
  - Inventory updates (e.g., *"Increase all hoodie quantities by 10"*) → Confirm no SKU desync.  
  - Metafield edits (e.g., *"Add ‘eco-friendly’ tag to all organic products"*) → Check batch processing success.  

#### **3. Visual Output & UI Integration**  
- **Dynamic Formatting**  
  - Product grids: Test image lazy-loading + responsive breakpoints (mobile/desktop).  
  - Data tables: Verify CSV export retains AI-applied filters (e.g., *"Export low-stock items I just asked about"*).  

- **Error States**  
  - No-results queries (e.g., *"Show vegan leather sofas"* in a tech store) → Display helpful alternatives.  
  - Permission errors (e.g., *"Apply 50% discount"* without `write_discounts` scope) → Explain missing access clearly.  

#### **4. Edge Cases & Stress Tests**  
- **Concurrency**  
  - 10+ merchants querying same product simultaneously → Confirm no duplicate writes.  
  - AI mid-process during product deletion → Validate transaction rollback.  

- **Adversarial Inputs**  
  - Gibberish (e.g., *"asdf123!@#”*) → Return "I didn’t understand" vs. crashing.  
  - Overload with 1,000+ product requests → Test timeout fallback ("Processing…").  

#### **5. Compliance & Logging**  
- **Audit Trails**  
  - Log all AI actions (e.g., *"12:05 PM: Updated 3 products via merchant command ‘restock’"*).  
  - Mask sensitive data in logs (e.g., *"Applied discount to [REDACTED_EMAIL]"*).  

- **GDPR/CCPA**  
  - Test *"Delete my last 3 search queries"* → Verify erasure within 24h.  

**Output Format**:  
```markdown  
[QUERY]: *"Add 10% markup to all watches"*  
[ACTION]: Writes new prices to 50+ products  
[RESULT]: ✅ Updated 52/52 products | ❌ Failed on 0 (Permission denied)  
[VISUAL]: Green success toast + undo button  
[LOG]: "2024-03-15 14:22: Price update by Merchant ID#4421"  
```  

**Pass Criteria**:  
- 95%+ intent accuracy (measured via merchant test panel).  
- All write operations require explicit merchant confirmation (no silent overrides).  
- UI renders correctly in Shopify Mobile App + desktop.  

*Test with real merchant transcripts, not synthetic data.*
