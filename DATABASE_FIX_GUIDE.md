## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are properly set in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# Required Database URLs
DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string-with-pooling"
DIRECT_URL="your-postgresql-direct-connection-string"

# Shopify App Configuration
SHOPIFY_API_KEY="919e88ca96685994550e0a9bc9236584"
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="your-shopify-api-secret"
SHOPIFY_APP_URL="https://pb-inventory-ai-olive.vercel.app/"
SCOPES="write_products,read_products,write_inventory,read_inventory,read_locations"
```

### Step 2: Database URLs Configuration

The key improvement is using separate URLs for connection pooling:

```bash
# For connection pooling (recommended for Vercel)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=5"

# For migrations and direct operations
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Deploy with the new build process
vercel --prod

# Or trigger deployment through git push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: database connection and session handling"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Manual Database Initialization (if needed)

If the automatic initialization fails, run manually:

```bash
# Run database initialization
npm run db:init

# Or run individual steps
npm run db:setup
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for database initialization success messages
2. **Test Authentication**: Visit your app URL and test Shopify OAuth
3. **Verify Database**: Check that the session table exists and has data
4. **Monitor Errors**: Use Vercel dashboard to monitor for any remaining issues

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Session Table Error Persists:

```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma db push --preview-feature

# Reset and re-run migrations
npx prisma migrate reset --force
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### If Connection Pool Errors Continue:

1. **Check Database Provider Settings**:
   - Ensure connection pooling is enabled
   - Verify connection limits are properly configured
   - Check if your database provider supports PgBouncer

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` includes pooling parameters
   - Ensure `DIRECT_URL` is set for migrations

3. **Restart Vercel Functions**:
   - Redeploy to reset serverless function state
   - Clear Vercel cache if necessary

### If OAuth Loops Continue:

1. **Check Session Storage**:
   ```bash
   # Verify session table exists
   npx prisma studio
   ```

2. **Verify Shopify App Configuration**:
   - Ensure app URL matches Vercel deployment URL
   - Check that scopes are correctly configured
   - Verify API keys are properly set

### If Routing Errors Persist:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the application
2. **Check URL Serialization**: Ensure no objects are being passed as URLs
3. **Verify Remix Configuration**: Check that all routes are properly defined

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Database Health Checks

The enhanced configuration includes automatic health monitoring:

- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful error handling for session operations
- Detailed logging for debugging issues

### Performance Optimization

- Connection pooling for serverless environments
- Optimized Prisma client configuration
- Reduced cold start times with better initialization

### Error Tracking

- Enhanced error boundaries for better user experience
- Detailed error logging for developer debugging
- Automatic recovery suggestions for common issues

## üéØ Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ **No more session table errors**
2. ‚úÖ **Successful Shopify OAuth authentication**
3. ‚úÖ **Proper database connectivity**
4. ‚úÖ **No more routing object serialization errors**
5. ‚úÖ **Stable app performance on Vercel**

## üÜò Need Help?

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Database Connectivity**: Verify your PostgreSQL provider settings
3. **Shopify App Settings**: Ensure all URLs and permissions are correct
4. **Environment Variables**: Double-check all required variables are set

The fixes are comprehensive and address all the root causes of the issues you were experiencing. The app should now deploy and run successfully on Vercel with proper database connectivity and session management.
