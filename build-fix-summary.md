# Build Issues Fixed - Vercel Deployment

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing @vercel/remix dependency
**Error:**
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@vercel/remix' imported from /vercel/path0/node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts.timestamp-1750985580616-9f550baf74b47.mjs
```

**Cause:** The `vite.config.ts` file was importing `vercelPreset` from `@vercel/remix/vite`, but the `@vercel/remix` package was not installed in the project dependencies.

**Solution:** Added `@vercel/remix` version 2.16.7 to the `package.json` dependencies.

### 2. Peer dependency conflict
**Error:**
```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error Could not resolve dependency: @vercel/remix@"^2.16.1" from the root project
npm error Conflicting peer dependency: @remix-run/dev@2.16.7
```

**Cause:** Version mismatch between @vercel/remix (requires @remix-run/dev@2.16.7) and the project's @remix-run/dev@2.16.8.

**Solution:** 
1. Updated @vercel/remix to exact version 2.16.7 
2. Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for npm install
3. Updated `vercel.json` to use `--legacy-peer-deps` during Vercel deployment

## Changes Made

### 1. package.json
```diff
  "dependencies": {
    "@shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-prisma": "^6.0.0",
+   "@vercel/remix": "2.16.7",
    "csv-stringify": "^6.5.2",
```

### 2. vercel.json
```diff
-   "installCommand": "npm install",
+   "installCommand": "npm install --legacy-peer-deps",
```

## Verification

✅ **Build Test Passed:** Successfully ran `npx vite build --mode test` which completed without errors
✅ **Dependencies Installed:** All packages installed successfully with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
✅ **Vercel Configuration Updated:** Deploy configuration updated to handle peer dependency conflicts

## Security Notes

- 7 moderate security vulnerabilities remain due to peer dependency conflicts
- These cannot be auto-fixed without resolving the @vercel/remix version mismatch
- The vulnerabilities are primarily in dev dependencies and don't affect production security
- Monitor for updates to @vercel/remix that support newer Remix versions

## Next Steps

The build should now work successfully on Vercel. The main issue was the missing `@vercel/remix` dependency which is required for the Vercel deployment preset used in `vite.config.ts`.
